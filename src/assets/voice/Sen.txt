Something is wrong

There is an unexpected malfunction in the system.

I’m not sure how serious it is yet.

Some operations may stop at any moment.

Please 

listen carefully.

To avoid any critical errors,

you must follow the next instructions exactly.

Don’t do anything else…

There is a problem with the following section;

 it doesn't handle fast scrolling well. 

Therefore, we advise you not to scroll quickly,
 as this may lead to unexpected behavior.

Okay, I'll make sure you finish quickly.
